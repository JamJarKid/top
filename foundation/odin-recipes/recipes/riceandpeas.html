<p>The most authentic Jamaican rice and peas recipe. 
    Rice, red kidney beans (peas), homemade coconut milk, and seasoned to perfection.
    Quick and easy rice and peas use canned coconut milk and kidney peas!</p>

<ul> Ingredients
    <li><strong>kidney beans</strong>:</li>
        I used dry kidney beans to give you a deeper understanding of traditional Jamaica. 
        However, you can use canned beans, and in the recipe card below, 
        I have made adjustments for cooking with canned beans.
        
    <li>Coconut milk</li>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <li>Scotch Bonnet Pepper</li>
    <li>scallion</li>
    <li>pimento</li>
    <li>garlic</li>
    <li>ginger</li>
    <li>thyme</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
</ul>

<ol> How to cook rice and peas
    <li>Prep the beans: If you are using canned beans, go to step three. 
        Wash the dry beans to remove dirt and leave to soak in clear water for at least two hours, 
        preferably overnight.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pressure cook : I suggest pressure cooking the dry beans because it reduces the time it takes to cook the beans. 
        Add the pimento berries, ginger, garlic, salt and beans to the pressure cooker and pressure for 15 to 20 minutes to soften the beans. 
        If you don’t have a pressure cooker but still wish to use dry beans, it will take 45 to 50 minutes before the beans cook.   
    </li>
    <li>
        Add flavour: Add the scallion, onion, thyme, scotch bonnet pepper, and coconut milk to the pot with the cooked beans. 
        If you are using canned beans, remember to also as the pimento berries (allspice), ginger, garlic and salt.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Rice: Wash the rice to get rid of the starch. 
        Add it to the pot, cover and bring to a boil. 
        Turn the heat down to low and let it steam until all the water evaporates.
